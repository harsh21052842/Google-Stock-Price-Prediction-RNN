# Google Stock Price Prediction using RNN

## Project Overview
This project uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) variant, to predict Google's stock prices. RNNs are ideal for time-series data like stock prices due to their ability to remember past information.

## Data
The model is trained on historical Google stock price data. 

## Model
The LSTM model learns patterns in the historical data and makes predictions about future prices.

## Usage
To run the project, execute the main script (e.g., `python main.py`). Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., TensorFlow, NumPy, pandas).

## Disclaimer
While this project aims to provide insights into stock market trends, it's important to note that stock price prediction is inherently uncertain. This tool should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.
